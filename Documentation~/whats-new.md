# What's new in Sentis 1.4.0-pre.3

This is a summary of the changes from Sentis 1.3.0-pre.3 to Sentis 1.4.0-pre.3.

## Added

- Functional API for building and editing models using PyTorch style syntax. This includes operator overloads, sliced indexing with ranges, and automatic type promotion.
- Quantization API for compressing model weights by up to a factor of 4. Quantized models take up less space on disk and use less memory during inference.
- Fast path for ScatterElements and GatherElements operations.
- All backends support the resize operator for all tensor shapes, and it includes support for the axes parameter.
- Pad operator supports integer tensors and wrap mode, and supports axes input tensor.
- Docs pages and package samples for new features.

## Updated

- Model serialization now uses FlatBuffers rather than binary serialization. This will allow far greater backwards compatibility for models exported in versions of Sentis from 1.4 onwards.
- Fixed many small importer and inference bugs for improved model compatibility.
- Renamed methods on Tensor and IWorker for clarity and consistency.
- Docs pages and package samples to be accurate to the new API.

## Removed

- Model API where inputs, constants, and layers can be edited directly on a model. See the new functional API where you can build new models as well as adapt and extend existing models.
- Ops for direct operations on tensors. See the new functional API where you can create models to perform optimized operations on tensors.
- Users can no longer define custom Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) layers due to their incompatibility with the new model serialization scheme. The custom import functionality will be reworked for an upcoming release.

# What's new in Sentis 1.3.0-pre.3

This is a summary of the changes from Sentis 1.3.0-pre.2 to Sentis 1.3.0-pre.3.

## Added

- Docs pages for exporting models and docs menu for project submissions.

## Updated

- Clip operator to support integer data type.
- Fixed inference and compatibility issues for Resize, Dense, Split, and NonZero operators.
- Inspector improvements including horizontal scrolling and operating while out of focus.
- Docstrings have been updated for accuracy and links to models in docs are fixed.

# What's new in Sentis 1.3.0-pre.1 and 1.3.0-pre.2

# What's new in Sentis 1.0

Sentis is the new name for the [Barracuda package](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.barracuda@3.0/manual/index.html).

This is a summary of the changes from Barracuda 3.0 to Sentis 1.0.

For information on how to upgrade, refer to the [Upgrade Guide](upgrade-guide.md).

## Added

- You can now override model layers in your code and add your own layers. Refer to the `Add a custom layer` example in the [sample scripts](package-samples.md) for an example.


## Updated

- All the backend types have been optimized and improved so Sentis as a whole has better performance on both the GPU and the CPU.
- The way Sentis represents tensors has changed to make Sentis compatible with more models and make it easier to convert Python preprocessing code into C#. Refer to [Tensor fundamentals](tensor-fundamentals.md) for more information.
- Sentis supports more ONNX operators. Refer to [Supported ONNX operators](supported-operators.md) for more information.
- You can now import models larger than two gigabytes.
- The [Model Asset Import Settings](onnx-model-importer-properties.md) window no longer has the options for `Force Arbitrary Batch Size` and `Treat Errors as Warnings` settings. Additionally, the `Open imported NN model as temp file` button is no longer available, simply use the `Open` button.
