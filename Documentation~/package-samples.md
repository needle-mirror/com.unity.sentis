> [!NOTE]
> Sentis is now called Inference Engine. The documentation has moved to `https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.ai.inference@latest`. Refer to the new location for the latest updates and guidance. Make sure to update your bookmarks and references accordingly.

# Samples

Samples are provided with the Sentis package to illustrate how to use the API and facilitate the learning process of using Sentis.

The available samples are:
- [Sample projects](#sample-projects) from the Sentis GitHub
- [Sample scripts](#sample-scripts) from the Package Manager

Validated models are also available to use in your project. To understand and download available models, refer to [Supported models](supported-models.md).

## Sample projects

Full sample projects are available to demonstrate various Sentis use cases.

To access complete sample projects, visit the [Sentis samples](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/sentis-samples) GitHub repository. This repository will be updated over time with more samples. Some samples contain a helpful video overview linked in the `readme` file.

## Sample scripts

Use the sample scripts to implement specific features in your own project.

To find the sample scripts:

1. Go to **Window** > **Package Manager**, and select **Sentis** from the package list.
2. Select **Samples**.

To import a sample folder into your project, select **Import**. Unity creates a `Samples` folder in your project, and imports the sample folder you selected.

The following table describes the available samples:

| Sample folder                           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                      |
