- `FunctionalTensor.ToString` shows the data type and shape (if known) for debugging when using the functional API.

### Changed

- Reworked and unified the `Worker` methods for setting inputs and scheduling.
- `IWorker` and `GenericWorker` to be an instantiable `Worker` class.

### Fixed
- Issues with the `Slice` operator on zero-length dimensions.
- Compilation of the `GridSample` shaders on consoles.

### Removed
- `GPUCommandBuffer` backend, in favour of a unified GPUCompute backend using command buffers.
- `IBackend` methods, use the functional API to create and edit models instead.
- Many methods and classes from the public API to keep it clear and maintainable.
